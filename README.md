# Classification-using-scikit-learn
An overview and comparison of different classification algorithms implemented in python using sci-kit learn library

The classification algorithms are used to classify Iris species dataset. The primary objective is to implement and 
compare different classification algorithms using performance matrix.

Following classification algorithms are used:
1. Decision Trees
2. Random Forest Classifier
3. Support Vector Machine
